    "# Flow Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to pass a value to a flow at runtime. For example, in a machine learning system with automated aspects, you may not know how to select an input to the model training flow, such as a hyperparameter search space, until it is time to run the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these cases you can pass values to a `metaflow.Parameter` in your flow. When you write a flow you can define which parameters the flow will take. Then you can pass corresponding values to the command that runs your flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python <FLOW SCRIPT> run --<PARAM NAME> <PARAM VALUE>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using parameters is a convenient way to quickly iterate in prototyping. For example, you might want to change a hyperparameter like a model's learning rate. "
