    "# Metaflow Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Metaflow requires the use of decorators. In Python code, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without the need to modify it directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In metaflow, there is  function- or step-level decorators AND there is also class- or flow-level decorators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flow Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.metaflow.org/api/flow-decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "These decorators are set at the flow level, i.e. above the class definition. In contrast to step decorators, they can't be attached on the command line using `--with`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@conda_base(libraries={'pandas': '1.0.0'})\n",

    "class MyFlow(FlowSpec):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@conda_base` - set libraries used by all steps.\n",
    "* `@project` - create isolated namespaces around flows.\n",
    "* `@schedule` - define when to run flows in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.metaflow.org/api/step-decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "These decorators are set at the step level, i.e. above the `@step` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, you can attach any of these decorators to the flow on the command line as well without changing the code using the `--with` option. For instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python myflow.py run --with retry --with batch:cpu=4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "attaches a `@retry` and `@batch(cpu=4)` decorators to all steps of the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@environment` - define environment variables for containers.\n",
    "* `@batch` - run on AWS Batch.\n",
    "* `@card` - enable reporting.\n",
    "* `@catch` - catch errors.\n",
    "* `@conda` - define libraries.\n",
    "* `@kubernetes` - run on Kubernetes.\n",
    "* `@resources` - request resources.\n",
    "* `@retry` - retry errors.\n",
    "* `@step` - define steps.\n",
